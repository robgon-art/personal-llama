            "Muybridge Derby refers to a series of photographs taken by Eadweard Muybridge in 1878. Eadweard Muybridge was a British-American photographer known for his pioneering work in motion photography. The Muybridge Derby photographs captured the movement of a racehorse named \"Occident\" during a race at the Palo Alto Stock Farm in California. Muybridge used a series of cameras placed along the race track to capture the horse's motion at different intervals. These photographs provided a groundbreaking visual study of animal locomotion and contributed to the development of early motion picture technology.\n"

            "After cropping the images, I ended up having over 12,000 paintings to work with. That’s enough to train a GAN, but not all of the paintings are good. Just because a painter is tagged on WikiArt as being “modern” doesn’t mean that all of their works are good examples of modern painting.

They came up with a way to train two ANNs that effectively compete with each other to create content like photos, songs, prose, and yes, paintings.  The first ANN is called the Generator and the second is called the Discriminator. The Generator is trying to create realistic output, in this case, a color painting. The Discriminator is trying to discern real paintings from the training set as opposed to fake paintings from the generator. Here’s what a GAN architecture looks like.\n",
            "A series of random noise is fed into the Generator, which then uses its trained weights to generate the resultant output, in this case, a color image. The Discriminator is trained by alternating between processing real paintings, with an expected output of 1 and fake paintings, with an expected output of -1. After each painting is sent to the Discriminator, it sends back detailed feedback about why the painting is not real, and the Generator adjusts its weights with this new knowledge to try and do better the next time.  The two networks in the GAN are effectively trained together in an adversarial fashion . The Generator gets better at trying to pass off a fake image as real, and the Discriminator gets better at determining which input is real, and which is fake. Eventually, the Generator gets pretty good at generating realistic-looking images. You can read more about GANs, and the math they use, in Shweta Goyal’s post  here .\n",

            "> RobG: Write chords for the first verse of this rock song.\n",

            "> GPT-4: Here are the chords for the first verse of the song:\n",
            "> G C Dogs and cats, they roam the streets Em D Furry friends with hearts that beat G C Claws and paws, they rule the land Em D Tails a-waggin’, they understand\n",
            "> Am C Side by side, they chase the wind G D Bound together, best of friends G C They’re rockin’ in the moonlit night Em D Dogs and cats, they’re out of sight\n",
            "\n",
            "\n",
            "The chords seem pretty good, albeit a tad basic. Like most Large Language Models, GPT-4 was trained on lots of text from books and the Internet and it seems to have picked up on enough discussions about chords to generate decent sequences. I like the AABA structure of the progression: G — C — Em — D, G — C — Em — D,  Am  —  C  —  G  —  D,  G — C — Em — D.\n",
            "However, there is an issue with text formatting. The chords don’t line up with the phrasing of the lyrics, i.e., the “D” chord should probably line up with “they’re” or “out” on the last line. I found an alternative approach that works fine: put the chords in line with the lyrics. I just had to ask.\n",
            "> RobG: Show the chords in line with the lyrics in square brackets separated by spaces.\n",
            "> GPT-4: [G] Dogs and cats, they [C] roam the streets [Em] Furry friends with [D] hearts that beat [G] Claws and paws, they [C] rule the land [Em] Tails a-waggin’, [D] they understand\n",

            "\n",
            "\n",
            "Ah, much better. Having the D chord start before “out” for the last line makes sense because “they’re” is used as a pick-up note before the next chord starts.\n",
            "In addition to generating chord progression, GPT-4 also explains things related to music theory. So I occasionally asked it questions about the songs I was working on, like this.\n",
            "> RobG: What key is this in?\n",
            "> GPT-4:  The chords provided for the rock song are in the key of G major. The G major key consists of the following chords: G (I), Am (ii), Bm (iii), C (IV), D (V), Em (vi), and F#dim (vii°).\n",
            "\n",
            "\n",
            "That seems correct. And I appreciated the full explanation of the chords used in the key of G major. Notice how it used both the letter names of the chords and the Roman numeral notation, where major chords are capitalized, i.e., (I), and minor chords are in lowercase, i.e., (ii.) I liked the way it used the ‘°’ character for the diminished chord.\n",
            "I used a commercial app called Band-in-a-Box (BiaB) from  PG Music  to hear what the chords sounded like. I typed in the chord names, pasted in the corresponding lyrics, chose a “rock” style, and it rendered the song. Here it is. Note that there is no melody, so feel free to sing along with your tune.\n",
            "That sounded pretty good. The chord sequence was fine, and BiaB did an excellent job with the guitar, bass, and drum parts. Without the vocal melody, the best parts of the tune were the guitar fills at the end of each phrase.\n",

He then adjusted the formatting by asking the model to place the chords in line with the lyrics. He also used GPT-4 to determine the key of the song.

            "> Diffusion models work by corrupting the training data by progressively adding Gaussian noise, slowly wiping out details in the data until it becomes pure noise, and then training a neural network to reverse this corruption process. Running this reversed corruption process synthesizes data from pure noise by gradually denoising it until a clean sample is produced. This synthesis procedure can be interpreted as an optimization algorithm that follows the gradient of the data density to produce likely samples. — Jonathan Ho and Chitwan Saharia [3]\n",

            "I started by downloading two datasets of Haikus from Kaggle.com from users hjhalani30 and bfbarry. The datasets were released under the CC0 and CC-BY licenses, respectively. The number of Haikus in the combined datasets is over 140K. I used FastPunct to add punctuation and casing to the Haikus and ran the KeyBERT model [3] to extract phrases used as prompts.\n",
            "I then filtered the data by using the GRUEN metric to gauge the quality of the text [4] and the phoenemizer library [5] to both count the syllables and convert the prompts and Haikus into phonemes. The filtering yielded over 26K relatively high-quality Haikus that all have a [5, 7, 5] meter.\n",
            "I used the GPT-J 6B model from Eluther [6] as the basis for Deep Haiku. After quantizing the model down to 8-bits to run on a Google Colab, I fine-tuned it using the filtered Haikus as training data for ten epochs, which took 11 hours on Google Colab with a Tesla V100 GPU.\n",
            "Generating new Haikus starts with selecting a word or phrase as a prompt, like “autumn.” I use the fine-tuned model to create 20 candidate Haikus. The results are filtered for adherence to the meter and optionally filtered to remove candidates that contain explicit language using the Detoxify library. Yes, Deep Haiku knows how to swear. The remaining candidates are then displayed along with the scores.\n",
            "For example, I generated 20 Haikus generated with the prompt “autumn,” and 11 used the [5, 7, 5] meter. Here are the filtered results with the scores.\n",
            "OK, the top 3 look pretty good, albeit a tad corny. But none of them used swear words, so the toxicity was near zero for all. The only slight blip was the sixth one that mentioned the “end of days” and “the cusp of death.” A little dark for a Haiku about autumn, but not exactly offensive.\n",
